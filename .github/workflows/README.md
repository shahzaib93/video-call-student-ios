# GitHub Actions - iOS Build Setup

This repository includes automated iOS build workflow using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ How It Works

The workflow automatically builds the iOS app whenever you push code to GitHub.

### What It Does:
1. ‚úÖ Installs dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Builds the web assets (React app)
3. ‚úÖ Syncs with Capacitor iOS project
4. ‚úÖ Builds the iOS app for Simulator (Debug)
5. ‚úÖ Uploads the .app file as a downloadable artifact

### What You Get:
- **iOS .app file** - Ready to share with client
- **Build logs** - Proof that iOS compiles successfully
- **No cost** - Completely FREE (GitHub provides macOS runners)

## üì¶ How to Download the iOS Build

After pushing your code to GitHub:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **"Actions"** tab
3. Find the latest workflow run
4. Scroll down to **"Artifacts"** section
5. Download **"ios-app-debug"**
6. Extract the .zip file to get the **App.app** file

## üì§ How to Share with Client

You can share the iOS build with your client in two ways:

### Option 1: Direct Download Link
1. Download the artifact from GitHub Actions
2. Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox/WeTransfer
3. Share the link with client
4. Explain: "This is the iOS build file (.app) - ready to install when you have the Apple Developer Account"

### Option 2: GitHub Access
1. Give client read access to your repository
2. They can download artifacts directly from GitHub Actions

## üîß Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the build without pushing code:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **"Build iOS App"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Select branch and click **"Run workflow"**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Configuration

- **Platform**: iOS Simulator (Debug configuration)
- **Code Signing**: Disabled (no Developer Account needed)
- **SDK**: iphonesimulator
- **Retention**: Artifacts kept for 30 days

## üìù Notes

- This builds a **Debug version** for Simulator (not for real devices)
- To build for **real devices**, you need:
  - Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
  - Signing certificates
  - Provisioning profiles
- The current build proves iOS code compiles and is ready for deployment

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If the build fails:
1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Ensure `package.json` has all required dependencies
3. Ensure `ios/` folder is committed to git
4. Check that `capacitor.config.ts` is properly configured

## üí∞ Cost

**Completely FREE!**
- GitHub provides 2,000 minutes/month of macOS build time for free
- Each build takes ~5-10 minutes
- You can build ~200-400 times per month for free
