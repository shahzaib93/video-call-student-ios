# Quick Setup Guide - GitHub Actions for iOS Build

Follow these steps to set up FREE iOS builds using GitHub Actions.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account (free)
- Git installed on your computer

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Git (if not already done)

```bash
cd "/mnt/d/project/tarteel/video calling/mobile-apps/student-app"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Student mobile app"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"New repository"** (+ icon → New repository)
3. Repository name: `tarteel-student-mobile-app` (or whatever you prefer)
4. Make it **Private** (recommended for client projects)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have code)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Push Code to GitHub

GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with the repository name you created

### Step 4: Watch the Build

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. You'll see **"Build iOS App"** workflow running automatically
4. Wait ~5-10 minutes for it to complete
5. Once done, scroll down to **"Artifacts"** section
6. Download **"ios-app-debug"**

## ✅ What You'll Get

After the workflow completes successfully:

- ✅ **ios-app-debug.zip** - Contains the App.app file
- ✅ **Build logs** - Proof iOS compiles without errors
- ✅ **Green checkmark** - Shows iOS build is successful

## 📤 Share with Client

### Option 1: Send the .app file
1. Download the artifact (ios-app-debug.zip)
2. Extract to get **App.app** file
3. Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox
4. Share link with client

### Option 2: Give GitHub access
1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Collaborators**
2. Add client's GitHub account (if they have one)
3. They can view builds and download artifacts directly

## 📧 Message Template for Client

```
Hi [Client Name],

I've completed the iOS version of the mobile app. Since we're waiting for
the Apple Developer Account, I've used GitHub Actions to build the iOS
project and generate the build files.

✅ iOS Build Status: SUCCESSFUL
📦 Build Artifact: [Attach or share link to ios-app-debug.zip]
📊 Build Logs: [Share GitHub Actions workflow URL]

The iOS app builds without errors and is ready for deployment. Once you
provide the Apple Developer Account, I can:
1. Sign the app with your certificates
2. Test on real iPhone devices
3. Submit to the App Store

The Android version is also complete and tested on real device (separate demo).

Please review and process payment for the mobile app development work.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## 🔄 Future Updates

Whenever you make changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild the iOS app!

## 💡 Tips

1. **Manual builds**: You can trigger builds manually from GitHub Actions tab
2. **Branch protection**: Consider building only on specific branches
3. **Artifacts expire**: Downloaded files are kept for 30 days (can be changed)
4. **Free tier**: You get 2,000 minutes/month FREE on GitHub

## 🆘 Need Help?

If the build fails:
1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Look for red ❌ marks showing which step failed
3. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies in package.json
   - iOS folder not committed to git
   - Capacitor config issues

## 🎉 That's It!

You now have FREE automated iOS builds without needing a Mac or Apple Developer Account!
